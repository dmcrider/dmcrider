## Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full-stack developer with years of experience in the Microsoft stack:

- C# is my primary language, though I'm also familiar with Python
- .NET Framework through .NET 6+
- TypeScript (Angular 14+, including standalone components)
- ASP.NET Core (for APIs)
- SQL Server and MySQL databases
- Azure (working on multiple Azure certifications!)

My recent projects have led me to some other languages and technologies like:

- Flutter for cross-platform development (write once, deploy everywhere)
- Firebase for authentication, storage, and serverless APIs
- Langchain, which is great for multimodal AI-powered apps!
