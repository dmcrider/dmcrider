## Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full-stack developer with years of experience in the Microsoft stack:

- C# is my bread and butter, but I have experience in Python, Flutter/Dart, and TypeScript
- VB.NET to .NET Framework through .NET 6 and beyond
- TypeScript (Angular 14+)
- ASP.NET Core
- SQL Server and MySQL databases

My recent projects have led me to some other languages and technologies like:

- Flutter for cross-platform development (write once, deploy everywhere; focused on mobile apps)
- Firebase for authentication, storage, and serverless APIs
- Langchain, which is great for multimodal AI-powered apps!
